abstract: Generative adversarial models with convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones have recently been established as state-of-the-art in numerous medical image synthesis tasks. However, CNNs are designed to perform local processing with compact filters, and this inductive bias compromises learning of contextual features. Here, we propose a novel generative adversarial approach for medical image synthesis, ResViT, that leverages the contextual sensitivity of vision transformers along with the precision of convolution operators and realism of adversarial learning. ResViTâ€™s generator employs a central bottleneck comprising novel aggregated residual transformer (ART) blocks that synergistically combine residual convolutional and transformer modules. Residual connections in ART blocks promote diversity in captured representations, while a channel compression module distills task-relevant information. A weight sharing strategy is introduced among ART blocks to mitigate computational burden. A unified implementation is introduced to avoid the need to rebuild separate synthesis models for varying source-target modality configurations. Comprehensive demonstrations are performed for synthesizing missing sequences in multi-contrast MRI, and CT images from MRI. Our results indicate superiority of ResViT against competing CNN- and transformer-based methods in terms of qualitative observations and quantitative metrics.
