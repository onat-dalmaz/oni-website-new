## About Me

I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by [Brian Hargreaves](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/brian-hargreaves#bio) and [Akshay Chaudhari](https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari). I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, where I was fortunate to work with [Tolga Cukur](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/). My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, computational MR imaging, and healthcare. Recently, I've been working on developing mathematical tools to improve explainability of image reconstruction algorithms.
