## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, co-advised by
[Brian Hargreaves](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/brian-hargreaves#bio) and
[Akshay Chaudhari](https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari).
Previously, I earned my M.Sc. and B.Sc. at Bilkent University under
[Tolga Cukur](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/).

My research sits at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and
computational MRI. I design probabilistic tools that turn
high-dimensional inverse problems into tractable uncertainty-quantification
tasks. The goal is to make deep image‐reconstruction models both
explainable and reliable for clinical decision making.
