Check out our [work](https://submissions.mirasmart.com/ISMRM2024/Itinerary/PresentationDetail.aspx?evdid=5132) "Noise-induced Variability Quantification in Deep Learning-Based MRI Reconstructions" aiming to characterize noise in deep MRI reconstructions, which I presented at Singapore for ISMRM 2024.
